Quicksorts in ATS2/Postiats
---------------------------


----

#include "quicksorts/HATS/stable-quicksort.hats"

This is a *stable* quicksort, and so (unlike most quicksorts) uses
O(n) workspace (in addition to the usual space for a stack or queue).

The current default is to use a random pivot, via a built-in linear
congruential generator. With this pivot choice, and with the order
predicate inlined, the sort seems to compete favorably against my
system qsort (GNU).

I have also implemented other pivot choices, but these currently do
not work well at all with large arrays. I do not know why. There seems
to be similar degradation with array size in the preludeâ€™s quicksort,
which uses median-of-three for the pivot. My processor type is AMD
Opteron 6344.
