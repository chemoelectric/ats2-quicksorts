Stable quicksorts for ATS2/Postiats
-----------------------------------

  List quicksort

Currently this sort has sometimes tested as faster than the prelude's
list_vt_mergesort, if the list is of notable size, the input list is
randomized, and the first element is used as pivot.

The current default is to randomly select a pivot, using a built-in
linear congruential generator.

  Array quicksort

The current default is to use a random pivot, via the built-in linear
congruential generator. With this pivot choice, the sort seems to
compete favorably with my system qsort (GNU), and may be noticeably
faster when the data is randomized.

I have also implemented other pivot choices, but currently these do
not work well at all with large arrays. Random pivot works fine,
however. Perhaps random pivot results in smaller subarrays that can be
handled more efficiently.

If so, then when the arrays are smaller to start with, breaking
subarrays up as evenly as possible (such as by estimating the median)
is likely to be faster. Nevertheless random pivot does rather well.
