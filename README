Stable list quicksort for ATS2/Postiats
---------------------------------------

Currently this sort has sometimes tested as faster than the prelude's
list_vt_mergesort, if the list is of notable size, the input list is
randomized, and the first element is used as pivot.

The current default is to randomly select a pivot, using a built-in
linear congruential generator.
