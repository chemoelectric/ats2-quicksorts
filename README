Quicksorts in ATS2/Postiats
---------------------------

Quicksorts as ATS2 templates, configurable by the template
mechanism. You can use either a strcmp-style function or a ‘less than’
predicate. You can change the pivot selection method. You can
configure when to switch over to the ‘small’ sort.

----

#include "quicksorts/HATS/stable-quicksort.hats"

This is a *stable* array quicksort, and so (unlike most quicksorts)
uses O(n) workspace. It is possible to provide your own workspace.

The current default is to use a random pivot, via a built-in linear
congruential generator.

I have also implemented other pivot choices, but these currently do
not work well at all with large arrays. I do not know why. My
processor type is AMD Opteron 6344.

The current ‘small’ sort is a binary insertion sort that first checks
for an already-ordered prefix.

----

#include "quicksorts/HATS/unstable-quicksort.hats"

This is an array quicksort of the move usual, unstable kind. It uses
O(1) workspace and seems to perform well, even on large arrays.

The current default is to use a median-of-three pivot. I have
implemented other choices of pivot, should you prefer one of them:
random pivot, and middle-element.

The current ‘small’ sort is a binary insertion sort that first checks
for an already-ordered prefix.
