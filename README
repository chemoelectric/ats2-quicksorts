Stable quicksort for arrays, in ATS2/Postiats
---------------------------------------------

This is a *stable* quicksort, and so (unlike most quicksorts) uses
O(n) workspace (in addition to the usual space for a stack or queue).

The current default is to use a random pivot, via a built-in linear
congruential generator. With this pivot choice, the sort seems to
compete favorably with my system qsort (GNU), and may be noticeably
faster when the data is randomized.

I have also implemented other pivot choices, but currently these do
not work well at all with large arrays. Random pivot seems to work
well, however.

Perhaps random pivot results in smaller subarrays that can be handled
more efficiently. If so, then, for arrays already small, a method such
as estimating the median may be faster.
