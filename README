Stable quicksort for arrays, in ATS2/Postiats
---------------------------------------------

This is a *stable* quicksort, and so (unlike most quicksorts) uses
O(n) workspace (in addition to the usual space for a stack or queue).

The current default is to use a random pivot, via a built-in linear
congruential generator. With this pivot choice, and with the order
predicate inlined, the sort seems to compete favorably with my system
qsort (GNU). When the data is randomized, my system qsort can be
considerably slower.

I have also implemented other pivot choices, but currently these do
not work well at all with large arrays. I do not yet know why.
